# 🎒 local.ai

A desktop app for local AI experimentation, model inference hosting, and note-taking.

It's made to be used alongside https://github.com/alexanderatallah/window.ai/ as a simple way to have a local inference server up and running in no time. window.ai + local.ai enable every web app to utilize AI without incurring any cost from either the developer or the user!

Right now, local.ai uses the https://github.com/rustformers/llm rust crate at its core. Check them out, they are super cool!
